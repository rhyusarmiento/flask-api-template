# Flask Api Template
- (Dan Docs)[https://gleek-dan.gitbook.io/dev-info/python-1/virtual-environments]

## Setup
- Setup Virtual Environment
```
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ _
```
​
- Install the packages
```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
​
## Running The Server
```
(venv) $ flask run
```
​
## Database Setup
​
We're using `flask-migrate` with `alembic` to do our database migrations.  You will notice there is already a migrations folder.  This keeps track of our migrations.  For more information read the [flask-migrate docs](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/), or [this tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database).
​
- Setting up an initial migration
  - You only need to do this if your starting fresh.  If you already have migration folder you can skip this step.
```
(venv) $ flask db init
```
​
- After changing a model run the migrate command
```
(venv) $ flask db migrate -m "Message"
```
​
- After running the migrate command, run the upgrade command
```
(venv) $ flask db updgrade
```

## Python Flask Shell

Sometime you need to go into a python repl to test some stuff out. Run the following command to have access to your flask variables . Go into the `main.py` to add more values.
```
(venv) $ flask shell
```
